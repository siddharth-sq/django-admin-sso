Django admin SSO lets users login to Django's administration panel using an
OAuth2 provider instead of a username/password combination.


Installation
------------

django-admin-sso is most often used with Google OAuth2 and the instructions
follow that assumption. At least in theory it is possible to use a different
OAuth2 provider.

1. Make sure you have a working Django project setup.
2. Install django-admin-sso using pip::

    pip install django-admin-sso

3. Add ``admin_sso`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in your ``settings.py`` file::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'admin_sso',
        ...
    )

4. Add the django-admin authentication backend::

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        'admin_sso.auth.DjangoSSOAuthBackend',
        'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
    )

5. Insert your OAuth2 client id and secret key into your settings file::

    DJANGO_ADMIN_SSO_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID = 'your client id here'
    DJANGO_ADMIN_SSO_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET = 'your client secret here'

Navigate to Google's
`Developer Console <https://console.developers.google.com/project>`_, create a
new project, and create a new client ID under the menu point "APIs & AUTH",
"Credentials". The redirect URI should be of the form
``http://example.com/admin/admin_sso/assignment/end/``

6. Run ``./manage.py migrate`` to create the needed database tables.

7. Log into the admin and add an Assignment.
